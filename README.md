#  Browzar v0.1
PHP file browser and syntax-highlighting text editor
Uses Ace.js on top of php

I found myself using this file more than my IDE (especially on 1 monitor environments).  It's usually faster to have this in one tab and my webpage in the other.  Every time I need a feature I add it in.

Features:
* Ability to select all themes from Ace.JS at will
* Saves files
* Creates new files
* Browses directory structure
* Takes a URL GET param for password to control access
* Recognizes some hotkeys (ctrl+s to save, ctrl+/ to comment block etc...)

Future Todo's:
* Delete Files
* Sync up with Github API
* Add more hotkey support
* Better security
* Way more other, better features
